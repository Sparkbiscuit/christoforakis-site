      "If you enjoy fairytale endings, this is not going to be a pleasant update.",
      "Unfortunately, the medicines that were so miraculously working have stopped being so miraculous. Lukas has been readmitted to the CICU, and it's frankly more dire than ever. His disease has progressed rapidly, and we don't know why.",
      "As of Monday night, Lukas has been placed on ECMO.",
      "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, commonly known as ECMO, is one of the most advanced cardiovascular life supports known to medicine. The machine receives your entire blood flow through tubes inserted into major blood vessels, then cleans, oxygenates, warms, and pumps the blood for you, allowing the heart and lungs to rest. However, it comes with its own set of risks.",
      "Lukas is constantly monitored by 2 or more people and wears oxygen saturation monitors all over his extremities, to ensure that he hasn't developed a blood clot that could cause him to lose his limbs, or worse, send him into cardiac arrest or a stroke. As, unfortunately, ECMO patients are prone to do, even with copious amounts of blood thinners.",
      "He's constantly receiving 10+ infusions into a central catheter that feeds into his major arteries. He's hooked up to so many monitors and machines it's hard not to get tangled just walking near him. It's impossible to express the severity of the situation. Even with the most advanced care in the world, it's only just enough to keep him alive until the now-certain lung transplant.",
      "And, speaking of a lung transplant: 1 week ago, we received an offer. We were overjoyed. The nightmare might finally ease up. But it's never that easy. When the surgeons flew out to verify that the lungs would be a good fit, they found that the donor had some sort of infection that would ultimately cause problems, should Lukas receive the lungs.",
      "I cannot properly convey the agony and despair in Lukas' scream when I told him that he wasn't going to get new lungs that day. It was the most heartbreaking moment of my entire life.",
      "All this is to say: we don't know what's going to happen next. Every day we can do nothing but wait. Every day in the CICU is spent in terror, even surrounded by the best doctors in the world. Every day Lukas spends without a transplant decreases his odds of survival afterwards.",
      "I'm sorry to deliver such horrible news. All we can do now is hope.",

    title: "Lukas is Home",
    body: [
      "On his 120th day in Boston Children's Hospital, Lukas has finally come home. Alive, and on his own two feet.",
      "There were times when we thought this may never happen. Hopeless times, when it seemed like we might never leave. Desperate times, when a double lung transplant seemed all too certain and his lifespan seemed to shrink in front of us.",
      "But against seemingly all odds, we are home. There are so many things that came together to bring us back here: Lukas' care team, amazing modern medicines, the support of the entire community. And crucially, hope.",
      "The experience of hope is difficult to convey in a message like this. It's something we had to learn across the last four months. Sometimes, it's easy to have hope. Like when you're told he's responding well to medicines (against everyone's predictions) and he might get to keep his own lungs, or when nurses start mentioning discharge day. Often, it was nearly impossible to have hope. Months in the Cardiac ICU with an uncertain future, awoken each night by running feet and other kids' alarms. Wondering if someday, the code blue will be for Lukas.",
      "Hope is born in those dark times. It's light in the abyss of despair. And the really curious thing is that the most powerful hope only comes when you've lost it all.",
      "If there's two things we learned from this experience it's how to hope and how to be grateful. On gratitude: we don't know how to express it enough, but we know how to feel it. Gratitude for the world-class care he received. Gratitude that we brought him in to the hospital when we did. Gratitude that so many people across the community came together to support us. Gratitude that somehow, medication worked for him. Most of all, gratitude for life. For the ability to leave BCH with a heartbeat, on his feet.",
      "We know many of you might want to know what happened. We did too, and it took a while to get the full picture. In the end, the likely story is this: Lukas has two conditions, one causing the other. The first, more insidious one, is probably Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD). This is when the small vessels in the lungs constrict and harden, making gas exchange difficult and blocking blood flow. This is the disease that the doctors thought would necessitate a transplant. The second condition, his initial diagnosis, is Pulmonary Hypertension (PH), which is a descriptive name for when something restricts blood flow in the pulmonary artery (the vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs) and causes an overpressure. In his case, that restriction was likely caused by PVOD. If untreated, he likely would have died of right-side heart failure within a year. Lukas is a unique case, but in similar cases, oftentimes the vasodilator therapies given for PH worsen the PVOD and/or result in intensely bad fluid buildup in the lungs. This is why a lung transplant was the likely option.",
      "Miraculously, though, as his care team gently experimented with vasodilators, they found that Lukas somehow responded well. The medicine (epoprostenol) had its own challenges: it was light-sensitive, and it had a three minute half-life in the body, after which the blood vessels would rapidly collapse back to their original width. So, for several months, Lukas was on a constant infusion. Finally, once he was stable and healthy enough, the care team transitioned him onto his current medicine, a similar yet much more stable drug called Remodulin, which comes in a little portable pump similar to what you'd see insulin in for a diabetic patient.",
      "For the near future, Lukas will also continue to receive oxygen, as it helps ease the strain on his heart as he strengthens more. You might see him around with a little canister in a backpack.",
      "There's a long road ahead medicine-wise, and all kinds of exciting new prospects in development. Right now, we are grateful for the incredibly advanced medicines and care that Lukas received and will continue to receive. Whatever's next, we're ready.",
      "Thank you all, for your support, love, prayers, and each one of the miraculous interactions we've had. Even though Lukas is not completely out of the woods yet, he's home now and he's so much healthier than we could have ever expected. We can't wait to see you.",

We've now seen the amazing level of support from people in our community and far, far beyond, and we think it might be possible to raise even more as we prepare for a tough few months in the CICU.",

      "My name is Oksana Christoforakis, mother of the 8-year-old Lukas. Just a year ago, Lukas was a whirlwind of energy, swimming, biking, racing his brothers, and filling every room with laughter. He was unstoppable. Then came the shortness of breath, the fainting spells, the moments that didn’t make sense. We thought it was something small, maybe dehydration. Instead, it was the beginning of something far more serious.",
      "Last week, after yet another confusing and seemingly random incident, Lukas was rushed first to Baystate Hospital, and then urgently transferred to Boston Children’s. What doctors found was heartbreaking.",
      "Lukas was diagnosed with 2 rare lung conditions, which both complicate and cause each other. Both are already 1-in-a-million, but together? A completely unique case.",
      "In the days since, dozens of specialists have tried to find a way forward. The conversations always circle back to one unimaginable possibility, a double lung transplant.",
      "Most don’t know this, but transplant is not a cure. It’s a chance for more time, but with enormous risks and lifelong challenges, and a median survival of only 6 years. Lukas is only eight years old. He doesn’t yet understand what all of this means, and for now we want to protect his sense of joy and hope as much as possible.",
      "For us as his parents, this has been shattering. Every morning, I wake up in a hospital chair, watching monitors beep and machines hum, wondering how our lives could change so completely, so suddenly. My husband and I are doing everything we can to stay strong for Lukas and his two older brothers. But the truth is that this fight takes more than emotional strength. It takes resources we simply don’t have.",
      "We are deeply grateful that MassHealth will cover his hospital bills. But everything else, food, gas, housing near the hospital, parking, the countless small costs that add up each day, has already stretched us to the limit. It is impossible to focus on healing when you’re also worrying about whether you can afford to remain at your child’s bedside.",
      "That is why we are asking for help. Our goal is to raise at least $25,000 to support our family through this crisis. Every single dollar will go toward making sure we can stay close to Lukas while he needs us most. Your gift, whether large or small, means we don’t have to choose between caring for our son and managing the weight of day-to-day expenses.",
      "We know these are difficult times for everyone, and asking for help does not come easily. But what we’ve learned is that community, love, and generosity are the only way through something like this. If you can donate, we are endlessly grateful. If you cannot, sharing Lukas’s story is just as meaningful.",
      "From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping us carry this burden. Lukas deserves more time. More hope. And more of the little joys that make his life so beautiful.",
      "With love and gratitude,",
